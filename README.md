# Namecoin Fullnode
Setting up a Namecoing Fullnode on a Raspberry Pi 2

This project was forked from ![Bitcoin Fullnode](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/fullnode/)

# Motivation
The goal of this project is to learn and layout a simple process for someone to be able to build a Namecoing Fullnode using nothing but low cost, open source available tools.

The main focus will be on educating and inspiring a new generation of people to begin hosting namecoin fullnodes to help decentralise the network and to encourage enthusiasts to become janitors of the blockchain.

Namecoin fullnode is very simular to the Bitcoin Fullnode with just a few subtle changes.

The namecoin blockchain is a lot smaller than bitcoins so it is not necessary to use a USB flash drive.

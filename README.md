# Namecoin #Fullnode
Setting up a Namecoin Fullnode on a Raspberry Pi 2

This project was forked from ![Bitcoin Fullnode](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/fullnode/)

# Motivation
The goal of this project is to learn and layout a simple process for someone to be able to build a Namecoin Fullnode using nothing but low cost, open source available tools.

The main focus will be on educating and inspiring a new generation of people to begin hosting namecoin fullnodes to help decentralise the network and to encourage enthusiasts to become janitors of the namecoin blockchain.

A Namecoin #Fullnode is very simular to the Bitcoin #Fullnode, as in you end up with a full or archive node however in this case you will be running the namecoin blockchain instead of the bitcoin blockchan.  This gives you the added benefit of namecoin e.g. a decentralised name and data registry.

NOTE: The namecoin blockchain is a lot smaller than bitcoins so it is not necessary to use an external data drive although you are of course welcome to.

# Namecoin #Fullnode
Setting up a Namecoin Fullnode on a Raspberry Pi 2

This project was forked from [Bitcoin Fullnode](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/fullnode/)

Please see the [setup.md](https://github.com/OpenProvenance/namecoin-fullnode/blob/master/setup.md/) file in this repo for the instructions

# Motivation
The goal of this project is to learn and layout a simple process for someone to be able to build a Namecoin Fullnode using nothing but low cost, open source available tools.

The main focus will be on educating and inspiring a new generation of people to begin hosting namecoin fullnodes to help decentralise the network and to encourage enthusiasts to become janitors of the namecoin blockchain.

A Namecoin #Fullnode is very simular to the Bitcoin #Fullnode, as in you end up with a full or archive node however in this case you will be running the namecoin blockchain instead of the bitcoin blockchain so this node gives you full accesss to the decentralised namecoin data registry and crypto currency.
